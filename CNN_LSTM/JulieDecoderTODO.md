## train\_decoder.py
Add command line option to control whether to use aligned or unaligned sequences?

Integrate with Shasha's CNN encoder --> Currently using dummy features to feed into LSTM

Use a validation set to do any hyperparameter tuning --> See below

Play around with model params --> Also review other hyperparams we could tune

## decoder.py
Clean up code, comments

Replace sample function --> Also will need sample.py eventually

## general
Possible to share embedding layer between encoder and decoder?

Consider architecture from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03017.pdf
