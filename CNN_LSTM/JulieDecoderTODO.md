## train\_decoder.py
Add preprocessing (IN PROGRESS)
Replace vocab
Replace data\_loader and for loop that iterates over training data
Continue adapting from use with images
Eventually, integrate with CNN encoder --> Currently using dummy features to feed into LSTM
Use a validation set to do any hyperparameter tuning --> See below
Play around with model params --> Also review other hyperparams we could tune

## decoder.py
Continue adapting from use with images
Replace sample function --> Also will need sample.py eventually
